Yangaroo Todo App

Tech Stack
- Backend
    - ASP.NET Core to manage the APIs (API Project)
    - Entity Framework Core to handle database persistence (Persistence Project)
    - MediatR library to keep code clean and maintainable. This is where all the business logic is located (Application Project)
    - SQLite database to store all data
- Frontend
    - React as the JS Library. I used Create React app to build the project
    - Material UI - CSS library to help with styling components
    
    

When running the .NET project, if there is no database, it will create one for you. The app will also seed one item into the database. The Backend application is setup to run on Localhost:5000. The Frontend application is setup to run on Localhost:3000.


Please provide me with any feedback as I am always looking to improve code quality. 

Thanks, and Happy Code Review!
